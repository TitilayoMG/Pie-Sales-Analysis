## Recommendation
Sundays and Mondays are the worst sales days so, create family-sized pie packs, offer delivery services and promote these packs as a way to spend more quality time together without the stress of cooking on Sundays will automatically boost sales on Sundays.

Partner with local businesses to offer lunch specials or catering options and provide discounted rates for office orders, encouraging professionals to choose pies for their Monday lunches.

Offer special deals on bulk purchases or frozen pies that can be easily reheated throughout the week. This will increase the sales by attracting busy individuals who are looking to prepare meals for the week.

Offer discounts or promotions during the morning hours to attract customers looking for breakfast or early lunch options. This can help set a positive tone for the rest of the day.
